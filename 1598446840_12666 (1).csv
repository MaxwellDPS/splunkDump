.NEW INFORMATION...
None.

.AREAS AFFECTED...
This local statement provides information and recommended actions
for people on Guam, Rota, Tinian, Saipan, Alamagan and Pagan in
the Mariana Islands.

.WATCHES AND WARNINGS...
A Typhoon Warning remains in effect for Tinian and Saipan. Damaging
winds of 39 mph or more are expected by Monday evening, and typhoon
force winds of 74 mph or more are expected Monday night.

A Typhoon Watch remains in effect for Rota. Damaging winds of 39 mph
or more are possible Monday evening, and typhoon force winds of
74 mph or greater are possible Monday night or Tuesday morning.

A Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect for Guam. Damaging winds of
39 mph or higher are possible Monday night.

A Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect for the islands of Pagan and
Alamagan in the Northern Mariana Islands. Damaging winds of 39 mph
or higher are possible on Tuesday.

.STORM INFORMATION...
At 7 PM ChST...the center of Typhoon Bualoi was located near Latitude
12.5N...Longitude 150.0E. This is about 340 miles east-southeast of
Saipan. Bualoi was moving west-northwest at 13 mph with maximum
sustained winds of 75 mph.

.SITUATION OVERVIEW...
Typhoon Bualoi continues to track steadily toward the northwest, and
this motion is expected to continue through Tuesday. This will bring
damaging winds to Tinian and Saipan, but the threat of damaging winds
will diminish for Rota and Guam as long as Bualoi moves as currently
forecast. The watches for Rota and Guam remain in effect primarily
in case Bualoi makes an unexpected left turn, or in case its wind
field expands. Now that Typhoon Warnings have been issued for Tinian
and Saipan, preparations for typhoon conditions should be completed
as soon as possible. For Alamagan and Pagan, damaging winds may occur
on Tuesday.","Preparations for the onset of damaging winds should be completed
as soon as possible. For your home or business, cover all windows
and doors with shutters or plywood. Move patio furniture and other
loose objects indoors. Brace exterior doors, including garage doors.

Items to bring to a shelter include a first aid kit, medicines and
prescriptions, baby food and diapers, games and books, toiletries,
a battery powered radio, a cell phone, flashlights with extra
batteries, a blanket or sleeping bag for each person, personal
identification, copies of key papers such as insurance policies,
available cash and credit cards.

...Winds...
Damaging winds of 39 mph or greater are likely as early as Monday
afternoon, and winds will likely reach typhoon force of 74 mph
Monday night. Once the center passes early Tuesday morning, winds
will shift to south and diminish to 20 to 30 mph by Tuesday
afternoon.

...Storm Surge and Surf...
Coastal inundation of 2 to 4 feet is possible as Bualoi passes
Monday afternoon through Tuesday. Surf will likely become dangerous
at 15 feet or more along windward exposures.

...Other storm effects...
From 4 to 7 inches of rain is possible through Tuesday. Flash
flooding or mudslides are possible in flood-prone areas and steep
valleys."

Custody was subsequently granted to the Cuyahoga County Division of Family Services. At this time it believed that Alexis is not taking her medication. Based on the psychiatric issues from which Alexis suffers, along with her inability to care for Emergy and current weather conditions, there is concern for the safety and well-being of Emery. The Cleveland Heights Police Department believes that the abduction of Emery by her mother poses a threat of immediate danger or serious  harm to the infant.","NO FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED."
